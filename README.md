# Intermediate-Layer-Output-using-Keras
This Repository contains the Output of each Intermediate Layer of a Keras Model for MNIST Dataset

The Dataset we will beuilding model for is the Popular <b>MNIST</b> Dataset by keras.

## Following Modules are required:.
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow

We have build the Model,Train the Model and we have created a Function name <code>visualize_conv_layer</code> which will plot resultant images of each Layer.
For More Information about this model, Check out my Article:
